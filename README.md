# Smart-Anomaly-Detection-System-AI-Powered-Detection-of-Unusual-Activities

Smart Anomaly Detection System is an AI-driven solution designed to identify unusual activities and security threats in public gatherings. Using machine learning and computer vision technologies, the system analyzes video streams in real-time to detect events such as theft, robbery, violence, or other suspicious behaviors, sending alerts to government authorities for immediate intervention.

Key Features

- Real-time Anomaly Detection: Continuously analyzes video footage to identify suspicious activities like theft, violence, and other unusual behaviors.
- Machine Learning Integration: Uses advanced machine learning models to classify and detect anomalies accurately, based on historical data.
- Computer Vision Technology: Leverages state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to analyze and process video feeds for detecting abnormal activities in public spaces.
- Alert System: Sends real-time alerts to security personnel or authorities with detailed information about the detected anomaly, enabling prompt action.
- Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale video feeds from multiple cameras in public venues such as events, malls, airports, or train stations.
- Cloud-Based Model: Ensures scalability, easy updates, and remote monitoring of video feeds and anomaly detections.

Technologies Used

- Python: The main programming language used for developing the anomaly detection system and training machine learning models.
- TensorFlow / PyTorch: Used for implementing machine learning models to detect and classify anomalous activities.
- OpenCV: For video stream processing, object detection, and image processing to analyze visual data.
- YOLOv5: A cutting-edge computer vision model used for detecting objects and tracking unusual activities in video streams.
